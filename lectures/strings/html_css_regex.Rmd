## HTML and CSS

__Markup language__

> "A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax." [Markup language](https://techterms.com/definition/markup_language)

__Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)__

- HTML is a markup language for the creation of websites
- HTML puts the content on the webpage, but does not "style" the page (e.g., fonts, colors, background)

__Cascading style sheets (CSS)__

> "Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages" [CSS](https://techterms.com/definition/css)

### Hypertext markup language (HTML)

Hypertext markup language (HTML) puts the content on the webpage, but does not "style" the page (e.g., fonts, colors, background)

overview
HTML puts the content on the page, but does not style the page
CSS = cascading style sheets, which add style (e.g., fonts, colors, etc.) to the content
Javascript : to add Functionality 
Page where you can see what html code looks like when run
https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default 
*all* of HTML consists of the following things:
Tags
Tagnames
attributes
Indentation and whitespace in your html script
Both are about making script readable for programmer
Html doesn’t care about white space
Html recognizes the first space in between words but not 2nd through 1 million-th space
Indenting is to make the script more readable; they don’t do anything


Tags 
Everything in html is considered a “tag”
Anything between opening tag and closing tag is considered inside of a tag
Can have tags inside of tags inside of tags inside of “body”
Tag can have one or more attributes
Attributes come after the tag name
Tag is what the thing is; attributes describe things about that tag
E.g., 
Example of tag called “frank”
<frank height=”300” intelligence=”high” /
Tag names
<html>
Must have <html> tag
<head> tag [goes inside html tag
<body tag>
Example of these three tag names in action
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head></head>
<body>


</body>
</html>
Note that <head> and <body> are inside the <html> tag
<title> tag would go in the “head”

```

### Cascading style sheets (CSS)

> "Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages" [CSS](https://techterms.com/definition/css)

1-minute overview of CSS   [NOTES FROM YOUTUBE VIDEO CUT OR CLEAN UP]

- Two basic ways to add style to HTML tags
  - Can use a “style” tag
  - Add CSS style directly in script that contains html code
  - Can use “link” tag
  - Link tag allows you to move CSS out of html into its own file
  - Programmers usually  use this appraoch because allows you to create separate CSS scripts of styles and then apply them to 
- Style tag
  - <style> contents of style tag here </style>
  - Anything inside open and closing style tag is not html
- A __CSS rule__ consists of three things
  - A __selector__
    - A selector defines Which html tag(s) to add style to
    - Within a single selector can change multiple properties 
  - A __property__
    - Which style element to change (e.g., color, opacity, background)
  - A __value))
  - Value to apply to style element (e.g., color: red;)
- Looks like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
selector {


	property: value;
	property: value; 
}
Selector
Choose which tag you would like to apply style to
E.g., add style to <h1>
h1 {


	property: value;
	property: value; 
}
Property
E.g., “color” is a property and “red” is a value

```
